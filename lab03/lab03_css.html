                Greetings, Adventurer!
                <br>
                This weeks update includes a few fixes and changes for the end-game, alongside some additional updates.
                <br>
                <h4>END-GAME UPDATES & FIXES</h4>
                Fixed an issue where the unlock messaging was inconsistent on higher Mutator difficulties. Difficulties 1 - 5 still states Silver rank is required and difficulty 6 - 10 now state Gold rank is required.
                <br>
                Fixed an issue where equipment couldnt be upgraded while storage was opened, if there were umbral shards in storage.
                <br>
                <h4>GENERAL UPDATES & FIXES</h4>
                The Absolute Terror items second Keen perk has been replaced with the Refreshing perk.
                <br>
                Fixed an issue that could cause players in PvP to enter a state where their movement speed was incorrectly adjusted for long periods of time.
                <br>
                Fixed an issue where the same player could be listed multiple times on the War/Invasion roster list.
                <br>
                Thanks for your support! We'll see you in Aeternum.
